This project is the creation of the game tic tac toe.

The goal is to use information learned on array methods, object creation, modules and factories. I am also to make my code least globally polluted as possible by making variables only useable inside functions or through returns. 

I will also use this project to try and write my code in more organized sections (where possible) by created comments and descriptions for other people who analyze the code.
