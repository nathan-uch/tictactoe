This project is the creation of the game tic tac toe.

The goal is to use information learned on array methods, object creation, modules and factories. I am also to make my code least globally polluted as possible by making variables only useable inside functions or through returns. 

So far, this has been the most challenging project I've done to date. I had a hard time getting used to modules and how to access information outside a module. I also had trouble thinking of how to organize my functions; what should each module control or do? Where should I place functions so that it is efficient?   

Challenges faced:   
-How should I organize my separate modules and factory functions?  
-Which methods and variables should reside in what?  
-How can one module access another's variable?  


Skills Learned:  
-Ways to access a specific div within a group of divs and changing its contents (IDs)  
-Factory functions & methods  
-Modules; private and public functions  
-How to access information from different modules  
-Making responsive website using @media in stylesheet
