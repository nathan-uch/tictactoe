This project is the creation of the game tic tac toe.

The goal is to use information learned on array methods, object creation, modules and factories. I am also to make my code least globally polluted as possible by making variables only useable inside functions or through returns. 

I will also use this project to try and write my code in more organized sections (where possible) by created comments and descriptions for other people who analyze the code.

Challenges being faced: 
-How should I organize my separate modules and factory functions?
-Which methods and variables should reside in what?
-How can one module use another's variable?
