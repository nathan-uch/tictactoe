This project is the creation of the game tic tac toe.

The goal is to use array methods, object creation, modules and factory functions. Also making the code as least globally polluted as possible by making variables only useable inside functions or through returns. 

Skills Learned:  
-Ways to access a specific div within a group of divs and changing its contents (IDs)  
-Factory functions & methods  
-Modules; private and public functions  
-How to access information from different modules
